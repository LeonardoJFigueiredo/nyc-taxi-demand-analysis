## Project Overview

Understanding taxi demand in relation to urban functional areas can provide insights into transportation needs and urban planning. This project aims to:

- Aggregate NYC taxi pickup data.
- Classify urban areas based on OSM POIs.
- Correlate taxi demand with these functional classifications.
- Visualize the results interactively using Altair.
